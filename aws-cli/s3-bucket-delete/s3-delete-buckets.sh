# AWS-Cli script that deletes objects, object versions and buckets.

# Usage:
# - Create an input file of a list S3 bucket names (physicalId) that are to be deleted.
# - Execute the script as normal by calling it from the command line
# - Weâ€™ll then iterate over the buckets returned from our list-buckets query
#   I wanted to add some kind of failsafe just in case my query picked up some buckets
#   that I might actually need (again this was in a sandbox environment, but
#   you can never be too sure). So we prompt the user for a y input.
# - If you are truly YOLO (or you prepared well - SA), you can use the yes program to
#   automatically accept every result, for example
#   `yes | ./s3-delete-buckets.sh` (Ed)
